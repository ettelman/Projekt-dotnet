        <p>
            The compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by Philips and Sony to store and play digital audio recordings. 
            In August 1982, the first compact disc was manufactured. 
            It was then released in October 1982 in Japan and branded as Digital Audio Compact Disc.

            The format was later adapted (as CD-ROM) for general-purpose data storage. Several other formats were further derived, 
            including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video CD (VCD), Super Video CD (SVCD), 
            Photo CD, Picture CD, Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-i) and Enhanced Music CD. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc">Wikipedia</a>
